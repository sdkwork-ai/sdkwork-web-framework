## Primary App Surface

The repository root is not the primary runnable app surface.
Runnable application roots live under `apps/<application-root>/`.

## Directory Index

| Directory | Surface role | Runnable | Purpose | Entry |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sdkwork-web-framework-pc | pc | yes | sdkwork-web-framework-pc | [README](sdkwork-web-framework-pc/README.md) |

## Allowed Content

- Selected language/architecture application roots with `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.sdkwork/`, and `specs/` when authored packages exist.
- Architecture-local `packages/`, `config/`, `src/`, `lib/`, `App/`, or `entry/` directories required by the owning architecture standard.

## Forbidden Content

- Repository-root API contracts, generated SDK workspaces, Rust crates, or deployment descriptors moved under `apps/`.
- Runtime secrets, user-private state, generated SDK transport output, or cross-application copied business logic.
